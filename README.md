# Push_swap

*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by myaroshu.*

## Description

**Push_swap** is a highly effective algorithmic project at 42 School. The main goal is to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed, you have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for distinct optimized data sorting.

The program calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push_swap language instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.

### Key Features:
* **Input Validation:** Robust handling of integer inputs, checking for duplicates, and overflow errors.
* **Sorting Algorithms:** Implements efficient sorting for small sets (3-5 numbers) and an optimized cost-analysis algorithm for large datasets (100-500 numbers).
* **Move Optimization:** Utilizes simultaneous stack operations (`rr`, `rrr`) to reduce the total operation count.
